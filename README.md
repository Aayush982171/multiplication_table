# Multiplication Table Generator ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python project that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

## ðŸ’» How It Works

- The user is prompted to input a number.
- A `for` loop runs from 1 to 10.
- The program prints the multiplication of the number with every value in that range.
